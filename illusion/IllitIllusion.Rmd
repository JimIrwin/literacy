## Overview ##
This project is exploring two related propositions.

First, widely-reported high rates of literacy in the US in the second half of the nineteenth-century US are simply and substantially wrong. A half-century's scholarly consensus dramatically exagerates the extent of writing skills in the nineteenth-century US. Current characterizations of literacy in the US rely on decennial census data, which are supposed to reflect counts of illiterates (those unable to "read and write"). However, scrutiny of the census manuscripts, combined with direct evidence of illiteracy from county court records (deeds) reveals a staggering degree of non-reporting of illiteracy. A mounting assemblage of evidence points to the conclusion that the census-based estimates dramatically overstate the extent of basic writing skills among the population. Although reading skills probably were widespread, current views understate the proportions of American adults who could not even write their names (to say nothing of writing sentences to communicate). A substantial research effort will be required to pin down that proportion among relevant populations of mid-century America (populations in terms of nativity, region, servile status, and race).  

Second, familiar characterizations of the US as a world-leader in literacy in the 19th Century are mistaken, stemming from inconsistent comparisons. European literacy comparisons rely on signature data from large populations of young adults (grooms, brides, and military recruits). Comparing the European signature-based evidence to US census-based estimates gives the impression that the US was far ahead of any European nation in terms of approaching universal literacy (defined as basic reading and writing). However, attention to the small set of signature-data available for the US points to the conclusion that the mid-nineteenth-century US was well behind Europe’s literacy leaders (the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Scotland, and Switzerland), with national signature literacy rates comparable to those in England and France.

### The Illusion of Literacy in the Antebellum US
There is a broad scholarly consensus that literacy (reading and writing) was widespread in the US in the mid-nineteenth century, and that the US was the world-leader in achieving mass literacy.^[For the consensus on widespread literacy in the nineteenth-century US, and the US as world literacy leader, see Engerman and Sokoloff (2011, and earlier works), Goldin (2006),  Graff (1987), Easterlin (1981) and Cipolla (1969, pp. 72, 99). There is some confusion in Engerman and Sokoloff’s reporting of census-based literacy rates for the US, which could distract us from problems in the underlying census data. Engerman, Sokoloff, and Mariscal (2012, p. 135) report white adult literacy rates in 1850 of 94-95% for Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania; those are consistent with illiteracy data in published census volumes. However, Engerman and Sokoloff report a white adult literacy of 96.9% for the US North as a whole in 1850 and 1860, in various other works published in the period 2000-2012, citing published US census sources. That 96.9% literacy rate (3.1% illiteracy rate) is not consistent with any published census data, which have adult illiteracy rates for northern whites of 6% in 1850 and 1860 (and much higher rates for southerners). Apparently the literacy rate of 96.9% was first published in Mariscal and Sokoloff (2000); it appears thereafter in Engerman and Sokoloff’s influential writings  (sometimes with co-authors) which culminated in their book (2011) *Economic Development in the Americas since 1500: Endowments and Institutions*. It bears emphasis however, that inconsistencies and errors in the reporting of US census evidence on illiteracy are largely irrelevant to the point developed below: the US census mansucripts dramatically under-reported illiteracy. Our current guess is that the US adult white illiteracy rate in 1860 was over 1/6.] Writing in the authoritative *Historical Statistics of the US*, Goldin (2006, Bc 2-387) sums up the prevailing view of the US at mid-century, describing literacy as "virtually universal ... among the free population" and identifying the US as "the best-educated country in the world". That view finds some support in the US censuses of 1850 and 1860, which suggest adult illiteracy rates for the free population of about one-tenth (Leigh 1870 p. 811), which is something like mass literacy. And even allowing for 100% illiteracy among enslaved African-Americans (about 11% of US adults), the census data imply that the US was well ahead of Europe’s leaders in the nineteenth-century rise of mass literacy.^[Summarizing census illiteracy data, and assuming 100% illiteracy among slaves, Leigh estimates adult illiteracy rates for the US of 23% in 1850 and 20% in 1860.  At that time, Scotland was the European leader in writing-literacy, with about 17% of adults marrying unable to sign their name to the marriage register circa 1855 (Stephens 1999, p. 127; 1855 Scotland, grooms 11%  brides 23%  (average 17%)). Reasoning that older persons were substantially more illiterate than newlyweds, it is safe to infer that adult illiteracy among Scots in the 1850s far exceeded the levels in the US census data.] 
     Viewed from the vantage of the US census evidence, there is little reason to question the consensus of America's literacy leadership in the nineteenth century.
<!-- ^[Little reason, but not no reason, because census publications repeatedly point to the likelihood of serious under-reporting ]  -->
However, the rates of literacy for the US derived from the nineteenth-century federal censuses are illusory. Starting in 1840, those censuses were supposed to identify illiterate adults -- those unable to read and write (in any language). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the nineteenth-century censuses featured massive non-reporting of illiteracy. Millions of blank illiteracy entries in the census manuscripts have been mistaken for evidence of literacy. An absence of evidence of illiteracy has been mistaken for evidence of an absence of illiteracy. As more evidence is collected, it will become clear that that writing literacy was far from universal in the mid-nineteenth-century US. Rather, "illiteracy was widespread," as Folger and Nam (1967, p. 111) pointed out over a half-century ago in their US census monograph on *Education of the American People*. Only if we ignored about half of the adult population -- southerners (white and black) and the foreign-born -- could we describe Americans as a literate people in the middle and later nineteenth century. 

#### Identifying Under-reporting of Illiteracy in the 1860 Census ####


Our research (2017) on “Women’s empowerment and economic growth: Albany, NY, 1760-1860” found unexpectedly high signature-illiteracy in Albany deed records from the 1850s. The federal census has illiteracy rates for white adults in the State of New York of some 5 to 6 percent in 1850 and 1860; but among Albany deed-grantors in the 1850s, over 8% were unable to sign their names, using a mark, rather than a signature, to endorse their deed. Of particular note, over 12% of the women signing deeds used a mark, compared to less than 5% if men, revealing a pronounced gender gap in literacy. We had expected deed-grantors to be above average in terms of literacy, based on considerations of social class, but we leave aside *a priori* analysis of the literacy of deed-makers versus adults in general. Instead, we move directly toward an improved empirical perspective.   

Our first step toward clarifying illiteracy in mid-nineteenth-century Albany was to look to the 1860 census manuscripts, locating illiterates in order to characterize them in terms of potentially relevant dimensions such as age, nativity, race, occupation, and wealth-holding. However, early on in the census-matching process a simple and dramatic result emerged: the 1860 census manuscripts largely failed to enumerate deed-markers as illiterate. The manuscript census schedules of 1850 and 1860 had one column to record illiteracy, titled "Person over 20 y'rs of age who cannot read & write"; the column was to be marked for any adult who could not read and write (an illiterate). But for the most part, the column was left blank for the deed-markers, who had demonstrated an inability to write. We don't know why the illiteracy coding tends to be absent, but we think the more important question is the extent to which the census failed to measure illiteracy. Blank cells in the illiteracy columns of the manuscript census have been taken as evidence of literacy; but our research reveals many many cases where the blanks are false negatives for the question "was this person unable write?" The question that looms is the extent to which non-reporting of illiteracy has generated an illusion of literacy, distorting our knowledge of the nineteenth-century US.^[The manuscript schedules of 1870 and 1880 used two columns to enumerate illiteracy, titled "Cannot read" and "Cannot Write", which were to used for persons age 10 years and older.]

We focus on deed-markers, people who made a a mark to sign a deed, as opposed to writing a signature, for one major piece of our effort to identify under-reporting of illiteracy by the census manuscripts. In a simple but painstaking process, using online genealogical indexes, we locate deed-markers in census manuscripts to check if they were enunerated as illiterate. The results provide compelling evidence that the 1860 manuscripts are rife with blank cells which represent a failure to record illiteracy. Drawing on our broader research on land markets in the nineteenth-century US, we have samples of deed-markers from six sets of County Court records. In addition to Albany NY, we have samples from two other northeastern counties: Worcester MA and Chester PA. And we have samples from two counties in Virginia: Henrico (which included the City of Richmond), and Surry, both located in the Tidewater (eastern Virginia).

Table MS1 reports our results (so far) from matching deed-markers to the manuscript census of 1860, revealing a dramatic degree of under-reporting of illiteracy. For example, for Albany NY we located 131 deed-markers in the 1860 census manuscripts, but only 29 of them were recorded as illiterate by the census enumerators, leaving 78% miscoded and appearing as literate in the census. It is worth noting that the 131 deed-markers were spread out over 25 different census enumeration districts, revealing a general failure to enumerate illiteracy, as opposed to a few idiosyncratic enumerators who miscoded. As Table MS1 reports, similar degrees of under-reporting of illiteracy are evident in Chester, PA and Worcester, MA, the two other northern locales for which we have carried out the matching exercise. In Chester, the illiteracy entry was blank for 48 of the 59 deed-markers we matched to the census; in Worcester, illiteracy was blank for 33 of the 44 entries that we matched. And in these counties, as in Albany, the non-recording of illiteracy was spread out over a large number of census enumeration districts -- 28 for Worcester and 21 for Chester. Taken together, the three sets of results give us results for 216 signature-illiterates matched into 62 different census enumeration districts, and well under one-quarter (22%) were correctly coded, as illiterate.

Table MS1 also presents results from two counties in Virginia, Henrico and Surry, both located in the state's long-settled Tidewater region. For Henrico, we have matched a sample of 48 deed-markers to the 1860 census, across 5 census enumeration districts. With 42% of the deed-markers correctly enumerated as illiterate, Henrico had less under-reporting than the three northern cases (where only 22% were correctly coded in the census manuscript). However, in part, Henrico's advantage reflect a near-complete enumeration of illiteracy among the six African-American deed-markers in the sample, five of whom were correctly coded as illiterate in the census. If we restrict attention to whites, the proportion of illiterates correctly coded drops to 36% (15 of 42). A similar pattern is evident in our results from Surry County, where the free population was enumerated in a single district, by one J. L. Hargan. For Surry, we located 22 deed-markers in the 1860 census manuscripts, 12 of whom were correctly coded as illiterate. But two of the twelve were free people of color, and the proportion of whites correctly coded was just one-half (10/20). In sum, our results from 6 census enumeration districts in Virginia in 1860 feature somewhat less under-reporting of illiteracy than we found in the 62 northern districts. However, the key finding for our purposes is that once again, the 1860 census manuscripts substantially under-reported adult white illiteracy. The Virginia evidence provides additional support for our contention that mass literacy in mid-19th century America will be revealed to be an illusion. 

If our results generalize, we might speculate that the 1860 census under-reported illiteracy by a factor about four, suggesting that the actual rate of adult white illiteracy for the US was about 36% (four times the rate from the census; Leigh (1870, p. 812)).^[Leigh's results (p. 811) include adult white illiteracy for the native-born white (7.6%) and the foreign-born (14.5%).] However, even looking past the relatively narrrow geographic scope of our results, there are good reasons to hesitate before concluding that the census under-reporting of illiteracy among deed-makers was representative of under-reporting among illiterates more generally. For example, perhaps stigma was an important factor in the under-reporting of illiteracy. One can imagine a census-taker discreetly overlooking occassional illiteracy among the "better sort" while dutifully recording the illiteracy of the less respectable (indigents, immigrants, people of color). But again, rather than chase down *a priori* possibilities to learn from our results, it makes more sense to work toward an improved empirical perspective. And we have done so by undertaking an intensive examination of enumeration practices in the 25 census enumerations districts of Albany NY in 1860.

### US Signature Illiteracy in International Perspective 
The most useful credible national evidence on 19th-century US illiteracy comes from Soltow and Stevens' sample of the National Archives records of enlistment records. Soltow and Stevens' sample provides a basis for at least a rough comparison to European cases, for which we have evidence on the writing ability of two sets of young men -- bridegrooms and recruits (or in Denmark, soldiers more generally). Of interest here are the rough magnitudes, and we find that the US fits with the second tier of European countries in terms of illiteracy (writing skills).

```  
\
Viewing the signature illiteracy rates in Table INT1 as nationally representative of the (writing) illiteracy of young men, we see the US falling short of the European leaders in literacy -- Scotland, Denmark, and Sweden -- but somewhat ahead of England and France.  Across the second half of the 19th century, the proportion of US enlistees unable to sign their name was substantially greater than the proportions of Scottish grooms and recruits in Denmark or Sweden (for example, in the 1850s and 1860s, one-quarter of US enlistees signed by mark, compared to about one-tenth of Scottish grooms or Danish soldiers). At mid-century, the US appears to be somewhat ahead of France or England (with signing by mark rates of 36% in France and 30% in England, compared to 25% in the US), but that advantage could simply reflect the absence of African Americans from the US army enlistments, rather than a greater writing ability among American men on the whole.^[To illustrate the magnitude of the bias, if African-Americans were 90% illiterate and 12% of population, then the table’s 1850s 25% illiteracy rate would rise to 33%, about on par with the values for England and France.] After the Civil War, the US army included African Americans, so that bias was gone.^[From 1870-1898 African Americans were about 10% of the US arrmy; Coffman (1968, pp. 365, 482), *The Old Army: A Portrait of the American Army in Peacetime, 1784-1898*.] It would be a mistake to put too much weight on Soltow and Stevens' national-level signature-illiteracy data to the trace out the evolution of literacy across the 19th century, but the data challenge characterizations of the US as the 19th century’s leading nation in the rise of mass literacy. 

The enlistment records for the US army in the nineteenth century are available at the National Archives in Washington DC, so a key next step in this research will be to engage in random sampling of the enlistment records, to develop estimates of recruit illiteracy over time, geographically, and with respect to demographic characteristics.

### Next Steps ###

#### Albany's Census Enumeration of 1860 ####
1) Random sampling of the manuscripts identifies three types of enumeration: ten districts with negligible enumeration of illiterates (adult illiteracy rates < 1/10 %); five districts with high rates of illiteracy enumerated (>10%); ten districts with non-negligible rates of illiteracy enumerated (2-9%).
2) using other illiteracy coding in other censuses to measure rates of under-reporting in 1860. Illiterates identified in other censuses can be found in the 1860 census, clarifying the extent to which under-enumeration of illiteracy extended beyond deed-markers. Key other censuses here are NY censuses of 1855, 1865, 1875, and the US censuses of 1850, 1870, 1880. 

#### Identifying Underenumeration of Illiteracy Across the US in the 1860 Census ####
Using the IPUMS-USA complete count coding of the 1860 census, we plan to identify census districts in which illiteracy was demonstrably under-reported. *A priori* we know of high-illiteracy populations of adults in 1860, who should have been enumerated as illiterate by the 1860 census -- examples include free persons of color, Irish immigrants, and French Canadian immigrants. Census districts with sizable populations of high-illiteracy groups provide a basis for identifying non-reporting of illiteracy. For example, if we find a census district has 100 Irish-born people and no illiteracy coded, we'll be confident the district's illiteracy data is not valid. Similarly, we may be able to identify districts in which illiteracy seems well-coded. Patterns in the data in such districts may permit us to infer illiteracy rates in the districts for which illiteracy was not reported.
