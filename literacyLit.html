histories of this period tend to suggest a pattern more of stagnation
than of improvement. However, evidence on schooling and other forms
of investment in human capital during this period is fragmentary.
This sets the tasks of examin-ing the evidence for educational
stagnation and how the relationship between educational trends and
economic change can be understood. ... Cressy (1980: 176), having
examined a range of sources such as legal documents which indicate
signature rates, has suggested that, at the accession of George I in
1714, approximately 45 per cent of men and 25 per cent of women could
sign their names (see Figure 12.1). Cressy&rsquo;s assessment is that
this re&#64258;ects continuous improvement since 1500, at which date
perhaps at best 10 per cent of men, and an even smaller per centage
of women, could sign their names. By this point, as Table 12.2 shows,
other countries already had an educational lead over England. North
America and Sweden stand out in this regard (Graff 1987: ch. 6).</p>

the ability to sign one&rsquo;s name. In the mid-eighteenth century
male signature literacy rates of 60 to 75 percent were typical in
rural parts of New England and Pennsylvania and those in Virginia and
the Carolinas were actually slightly higher. (footnote to Grubb,
Growth of Literacy, p. 453-4) Such regional differences in illiteracy
as had developed over the next century, according to federal
censuses, converged substantially between 1840 and 1850, which Frank
Owsley noted many years ago. By the mid-nineteenth century, Owsley
observed, white literacy rates in the South compared favorably to the

improvement could be seen, the gains for women were not unequivocal.
As Mary Beth Norton has shown, after the Revolution &ldquo;public

male children, and private academies founded in the 1780s and 1790s
greatly expanded the curriculum previously offered to girls.&rdquo;

also in-dicates, the academies were for the most part restricted to
affluent girls and often were less institutions of higher learning
than elite &nbsp;&ldquo;finishing&rdquo; schools, offering subjects
such as embroidery, dancing, drawing, oratory, and other genteel
arts. In rural areas and among the poor women&rsquo;s education
continued to be rudimentary in the post-revolutionary era, and not
surprisingly women&rsquo;s literacy levels (es-pecially advanced
